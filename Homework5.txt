Homework: Variable Type vs Object Type
1. Which of the followings is considered boxing?
a. double dblx = fx;
b. float fx = ix;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = objy;

Asnwer: C;
2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing?
a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy;

Answer: D;
3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.
float fx = objdblx;
float fx = (float)(double) objdblx;
4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.
double dx = objflx;
double dx = (double)(float) objflx;
5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:
double dblx = Convert.ToDouble(strx);	
6. Convert the integer ix to a float fx:
float fx = Convert.ToSingle(ix);
7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:
string strx = Convert.ToString(dblx);
8. Object is the base                 class of all other data types.
9. What is an object (the definition)?
Objects are instances and they can be stored in a named variable or in array.

10. How do you declare an object in C#?
object myobj = 10;
What is the difference between an object and a variable?
      Object holds many variable and methods versus a variable holds single piece of data.
